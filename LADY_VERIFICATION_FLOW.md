**Purpose**: Complete documentation of the lady verification system flow  
**Status**: Implementation Reference Guide

---

## 🌊 **Complete Verification Flow - End to End**

---

## 👤 **User Registration & Initial Flow**

### **1. New Lady Registration**
```
User visits /register → Fills form → Clicks "Register as Lady" 
→ Account created in database (is_verified: false)
→ User logged in automatically
→ AuthContext updated with user data
```

### **2. Post-Registration Redirect**
```
Registration Success → Check user.is_verified 
→ IF verified: Redirect to /dashboard/lady
→ IF NOT verified: Redirect to /verification (MANDATORY)
```

### **3. Route Protection (VerificationGuard)**
```
User tries to access ANY dashboard route
→ VerificationGuard checks: user.is_verified
→ IF false: Redirect to /verification 
→ IF true: Allow access to requested route

ALLOWED for unverified users:
- /verification (the upload page)
- /logout
- / (homepage)
- /login
- /register

BLOCKED for unverified users:
- /dashboard/* (all dashboard routes)
- /booking
- /send-gift
- Any protected functionality
```

---

## 📄 **Document Upload Flow**

### **4. Verification Page (/verification)**
```
Lady lands on verification page
→ Sees 4 document upload sections:
   1. 📄 ID Card Photo
   2. 🤳 Selfie with ID  
   3. 📰 Newspaper Photo
   4. 📸 Upper Body Selfie

→ Each section shows:
   - Clear instructions
   - Upload area (drag/drop or click)
   - Progress indicator
   - Preview when uploaded
```

### **5. Individual Document Upload Process**
```
User clicks upload area or drags file
→ File validation (size, type, dimensions)
→ IF invalid: Show error message
→ IF valid: Upload to Supabase Storage
→ Get signed URL for file
→ Save to lady_verification_documents table:
   - lady_id: current user ID
   - document_type: 'id_card' | 'selfie_with_id' | etc.
   - file_url: Supabase storage URL
   - upload_status: 'success'
   - verification_status: 'pending'
→ Update UI: Show preview + checkmark
```

### **6. Submission Process**
```
User uploads all 4 documents (4/4 complete)
→ "Submit for Verification" button becomes active
→ User clicks submit
→ Update users table:
   - verification_submitted_at: now()
→ Show success message: "Documents submitted for review"
→ UI changes to "Pending Approval" state
```

---

## 👨‍💼 **Admin Review Flow**

### **7. Admin Dashboard Access**
```
Admin logs in → Redirected to /dashboard/admin
→ Sees verification queue with priority scoring:
   - High priority: Submitted but not reviewed
   - Medium priority: Old accounts without submission
   - Low priority: New accounts
```

### **8. Document Review Process**
```
Admin clicks on user in verification queue
→ Opens document review panel
→ Sees all 4 documents with:
   - Large image viewer
   - Zoom functionality
   - Side-by-side comparison (ID vs selfie)
   - Individual approve/reject buttons
   - Bulk approve/reject all
   - Notes field for comments
```

### **9. Admin Decision Making**
```
FOR EACH DOCUMENT:
Admin reviews → Decides:
→ APPROVE: 
   - Update verification_status: 'approved'
   - Set verified_at: now()
   - Set admin_id: current admin
   - Log action in admin_actions table

→ REJECT:
   - Update verification_status: 'rejected'
   - Set rejection_reason: selected reason
   - Set admin_id: current admin
   - Log action in admin_actions table
```

### **10. Final User Approval**
```
When ALL 4 documents are approved:
→ Update users table:
   - is_verified: true
   - verified_at: now()
   - can_post_premium: true
   - verified_by_admin: admin_id
→ Log admin action: 'approve_user'
→ Send notification to user (future feature)
```

---

## 🔄 **User Experience After Submission**

### **11. Pending State**
```
While documents are under review:
→ User can access /verification page
→ Shows "Under Review" status
→ Cannot access dashboard
→ Can see progress: "4/4 documents submitted, awaiting approval"
```

### **12. Approval Notification**
```
When admin approves all documents:
→ User's next login/page refresh
→ AuthContext updates: user.is_verified = true
→ VerificationGuard allows dashboard access
→ User can now access full dashboard
→ Premium features unlocked
```

### **13. Rejection Handling**
```
If any document is rejected:
→ User sees rejection status on /verification
→ Shows specific rejection reasons
→ Allows re-upload of rejected documents
→ Process starts over for rejected items
```

---

## 🔒 **Security & Data Flow**

### **14. Database Operations**

#### **Document Upload:**
```sql
INSERT INTO lady_verification_documents (
  lady_id, document_type, file_url, file_name, 
  upload_status, verification_status
) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, 'success', 'pending');
```

#### **Admin Review:**
```sql
UPDATE lady_verification_documents 
SET verification_status = 'approved', 
    verified_at = now(), 
    admin_id = $1
WHERE id = $2;
```

#### **User Verification:**
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET is_verified = true, 
    verified_at = now(), 
    can_post_premium = true,
    verified_by_admin = $1
WHERE id = $2;
```

### **15. File Storage Security**
```
Supabase Storage:
→ Files stored in 'verification-documents' bucket
→ RLS policies: Only user and admins can access their files
→ Signed URLs for secure access
→ Automatic cleanup of rejected documents (future)
```

```
App.tsx
├── VerificationGuard (wraps protected routes)
├── Routes:
    ├── /verification → Verification.tsx
    │   └── DocumentUpload.tsx (x4 instances)
    │       └── FileUploader.tsx
    │       └── ImagePreview.tsx
    └── /dashboard/admin → AdminVerification.tsx
        ├── VerificationQueue.tsx
        └── DocumentReviewer.tsx
            └── ImageViewer.tsx
```

### **17. State Management Flow**

#### **AuthContext:**
```typescript
interface AuthUser {
  is_verified: boolean;
  verification_submitted_at: string | null;
  can_post_premium: boolean;
  role: 'lady' | 'client' | 'club' | 'admin';
}
```

#### **Verification Page State:**
```typescript
interface VerificationState {
  documents: {
    id_card: { uploaded: boolean; url?: string; fileName?: string };
    selfie_with_id: { uploaded: boolean; url?: string; fileName?: string };
    newspaper_photo: { uploaded: boolean; url?: string; fileName?: string };
    upper_body_selfie: { uploaded: boolean; url?: string; fileName?: string };
  };
  uploadProgress: {
    id_card: number; // 0-100
    selfie_with_id: number;
    newspaper_photo: number;
    upper_body_selfie: number;
  };
  isSubmitting: boolean;
  completionPercentage: number;
}
```

#### **Admin Dashboard State:**
```typescript
interface AdminState {
  verificationQueue: VerificationQueueItem[];
  selectedUser: User | null;
  selectedDocument: Document | null;
  isProcessing: boolean;
}
```

- Database constraint violations
```

---

## 🚀 **Implementation Dependencies**

### **20. Prerequisites**
```
✅ Database schema (COMPLETED)
   - lady_verification_documents table
   - Enhanced users table
   - admin_actions table
   - verification_queue view

✅ Supabase setup (EXISTING)

## 💡 **Key Design Decisions**

### **22. Architecture Choices**
- **Mandatory Verification**: No dashboard access until verified
- **Real-time Updates**: Admin actions immediately update user status
- **Progressive Upload**: Users can upload documents one by one
- **Individual Approval**: Admins can approve/reject each document separately
- **Audit Trail**: All admin actions logged for accountability

### **23. User Experience Priorities**
- **Clear Progress**: Always show completion status (1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4)
- **Helpful Guidance**: Detailed instructions for each document type
- **Mobile Friendly**: Camera integration for direct photo capture
- **Error Recovery**: Easy re-upload on rejection with clear reasons
- **Admin Efficiency**: Batch operations and keyboard shortcuts

### **24. Document Requirements**

#### **Document Types & Instructions:**
1. **📄 ID Card Photo**
   - "A photo of your ID card / Passport or Drivers License"
   - Must be clear, readable, not expired
   - All text must be visible

2. **🤳 Selfie with ID**
   - "A photo of you holding your ID card"
   - Face must match ID photo
   - ID must be clearly visible
   - Both face and ID in same frame

3. **📰 Newspaper Photo**
   - "A photo of you holding a newspaper of the country where you advertise"
   - "Make sure we can read the date of the newspaper"
   - Proves location and recency
   - Date must be clearly visible

4. **📸 Upper Body Selfie**
   - "A clear photo/selfie of you and upper body"
   - For profile verification
   - Good lighting, clear image
   - Professional appearance

## 🔧 **Technical Specifications**

### **25. File Upload Requirements**
```typescript
interface FileValidation {
  maxSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB
  allowedTypes: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'];
  minDimensions: { width: 800, height: 600 };
  maxDimensions: { width: 4000, height: 4000 };
}
```

### **26. Storage Structure**
```
verification-documents/
├── {user_id}/
    ├── id_card_{timestamp}.jpg
    ├── selfie_with_id_{timestamp}.jpg
    ├── newspaper_photo_{timestamp}.jpg
    └── upper_body_selfie_{timestamp}.jpg
```

### **27. Database Constraints**
```sql
-- Ensure only one document per type per user
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_lady_verification_unique_document 
ON lady_verification_documents(lady_id, document_type);

-- Ensure lady_id references a user with role 'lady'
ALTER TABLE lady_verification_documents 
ADD CONSTRAINT check_lady_role 
CHECK (EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM users 
  WHERE id = lady_id AND role = 'lady'
));
```

## Implementation Details

### VerificationGuard Component Architecture

```typescript
interface VerificationGuardProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  fallback?: React.ReactNode;
  redirectTo?: string;
  showPrompt?: boolean;
}
```

**Three UI States:**
1. **VerificationPrompt** - For users who haven't submitted documents
2. **VerificationPending** - For users with documents under review
3. **VerificationRejected** - For users whose documents were rejected

**Integration Points:**
- `LadyDashboard.tsx` - Wraps entire dashboard content
- `LadyDashboardFree.tsx` - Protects free tier dashboard
- `App.tsx` - Added /verification route with role protection
- `useUserProfile.ts` - Extended with verification fields

**Database Fields Added to UserProfile:**
```typescript
verification_status?: 'not_submitted' | 'pending' | 'verified' | 'rejected';
verification_submitted_at?: string;
verification_rejection_reason?: string;
verified_at?: string;
verified_by_admin?: string;
```

### Security & User Experience

**Role-Based Protection:**
- Only applies verification guard to users with role='lady'
- Other user types (client, club, admin) bypass the guard completely
- Maintains existing ProtectedRoute and MembershipGuard functionality

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Loading states while checking verification status
- Error handling for API failures
- Fallback options for custom implementations

**User Journey:**
1. Lady logs in → Redirected to appropriate dashboard
2. VerificationGuard checks verification status
3. If not verified → Shows appropriate prompt with benefits
4. User clicks "Start Verification" → Navigates to /verification
5. Completes document upload → Returns to pending state
6. Admin approves → Full dashboard access granted

### Next Steps Priority

**Immediate (Phase 1.2E - 15 mins):**
- Registration flow integration
- New user welcome with verification prompt

**High Priority (Phase 2 - 2-3 hours):**
- Admin dashboard for document review
- Approval/rejection workflow
- Notification system for status updates

**Medium Priority (Phase 3-4 - 3-4 hours):**
- Club verification system
- Membership tier integration
- Advanced analytics and reporting

The VerificationGuard is now fully functional and provides a seamless user experience that encourages verification while maintaining security and proper access control.
