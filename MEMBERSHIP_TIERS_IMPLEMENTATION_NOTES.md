# Membership Tiers Implementation Notes

## Current Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: FREE vs PRO Only (Current Focus)
**Decision Date**: January 2025  
**Rationale**: Start with core functionality using the two primary tiers before expanding to additional premium tiers.

#### Current Implementation Scope:
- **FREE Tier**: Basic features, limited functionality
- **PRO Tier**: Full feature access, premium capabilities

#### Simplified Type Definitions:
```typescript
// Current implementation uses:
type MembershipTier = 'FREE' | 'PRO';

// Instead of the full definition:
type MembershipTier = 'FREE' | 'PRO' | 'PRO-PLUS' | 'ULTRA';
```

#### Routing Logic:
- **FREE users** → `/dashboard/lady/free` (LadyDashboardFree component)
- **PRO users** → `/dashboard/lady` (LadyDashboard component)

#### Feature Access Logic:
```typescript
// Current simplified logic:
const hasProAccess = membershipTier === 'PRO';
const hasAdvancedFeatures = membershipTier === 'PRO';
```

## Future Implementation: PRO-PLUS and ULTRA Tiers

### Phase 2: Add PRO-PLUS and ULTRA (Future)
**Status**: Designed but not implemented  
**Database Schema**: Already supports all 4 tiers  
**UI Design**: Partially implemented in `MembershipTier.tsx`

#### Planned Tier Structure:
1. **FREE** - €0/day - Basic features
2. **PRO** - €5/day - Full features + 25 DK credits/day
3. **PRO-PLUS** - €10/day - Enhanced features + 50 DK credits/day
4. **ULTRA** - €50/day - Premium features + 250 DK credits/day

#### Future Feature Differentiation:
```typescript
// Future implementation will use:
const featureAccess = {
  FREE: {
    fanPosts: false,
    onlineBooking: false,
    giftManagement: false,
    prioritySupport: false,
    customUrl: false,
    topSearchResults: false
  },
  PRO: {
    fanPosts: true,
    onlineBooking: true,
    giftManagement: true,
    prioritySupport: true,
    customUrl: false,
    topSearchResults: false
  },
  'PRO-PLUS': {
    fanPosts: true,
    onlineBooking: true,
    giftManagement: true,
    prioritySupport: true,
    customUrl: true,
    topSearchResults: false,
    featuredInSearch: true
  },
  ULTRA: {
    fanPosts: true,
    onlineBooking: true,
    giftManagement: true,
    prioritySupport: true,
    customUrl: true,
    topSearchResults: true,
    featuredInSearch: true,
    exclusiveBadge: true,
    vipSupport: true
  }
};
```

## Files That Will Need Updates for Future Expansion

### Core Files (Phase 2 Updates Required):
1. **Type Definitions**:
   - `src/types.ts` - Update membershipTier type
   - `src/lib/database.types.ts` - Already supports all tiers

2. **Authentication & Access Control**:
   - `src/utils/authUtils.ts` - Update tier checking logic
   - `src/components/auth/MembershipGuard.tsx` - Expand tier validation

3. **Routing & Components**:
   - `src/components/auth/RoleBasedRedirect.tsx` - Add PRO-PLUS/ULTRA routing
   - `src/App.tsx` - May need additional route protection

4. **Dashboard Components**:
   - Consider: Separate dashboards for each tier vs. dynamic features
   - `src/pages/dashboard/LadyDashboard.tsx` - Could serve PRO+ tiers
   - Feature gating within components based on exact tier

5. **Services & API**:
   - `src/services/membershipValidationService.ts` - Expand validation logic
   - Feature access calculation functions

### UI/UX Components (Phase 2):
1. **Badge System**:
   - `src/components/ui/MembershipBadge.tsx` - Add PRO-PLUS/ULTRA badges
   - Color schemes and icons for each tier

2. **Upgrade Flows**:
   - `src/pages/dashboard/UpgradeMembership.tsx` - Already partially implemented
   - Progressive upgrade paths (FREE→PRO→PRO-PLUS→ULTRA)

3. **Feature Indicators**:
   - Tier-specific feature availability indicators
   - Client-facing tier visibility enhancements

## Technical Considerations for Future Expansion

### Database Considerations:
- **Schema**: Already supports all 4 tiers ✅
- **Migrations**: No schema changes needed for tier expansion
- **Indexing**: May need performance optimizations for tier-based queries

### Performance Considerations:
- **Caching**: Implement tier-based feature caching
- **Query Optimization**: Optimize database queries for tier filtering
- **Bundle Size**: Consider code splitting for tier-specific features

### Business Logic Considerations:
- **Upgrade Paths**: Design smooth upgrade/downgrade flows
- **Feature Migration**: How to handle features when users change tiers
- **Billing Integration**: Implement proper billing for multiple tiers

## Implementation Checklist for Future Phase 2

### Prerequisites:
- [ ] Complete FREE vs PRO implementation and testing
- [ ] Analyze user adoption and feedback
- [ ] Define specific PRO-PLUS and ULTRA feature requirements
- [ ] Design billing/payment integration for additional tiers

### Development Tasks:
- [ ] Update type definitions to include all 4 tiers
- [ ] Implement tier-specific feature access logic
- [ ] Create/update UI components for additional tiers
- [ ] Add routing logic for PRO-PLUS/ULTRA users
- [ ] Implement progressive upgrade flows
- [ ] Update client-facing tier indicators
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing for all tier combinations

### Testing Strategy:
- [ ] Unit tests for all tier combinations
- [ ] Integration tests for upgrade/downgrade flows
- [ ] User acceptance testing for each tier experience
- [ ] Performance testing with tier-based feature loading

## Current vs Future Architecture

### Current (Phase 1):
```
FREE → LadyDashboardFree (basic features)
PRO  → LadyDashboard (full features)
```

### Future (Phase 2):
```
FREE      → LadyDashboardFree (basic features)
PRO       → LadyDashboard (full features)
PRO-PLUS  → LadyDashboard (enhanced features)
ULTRA     → LadyDashboard (premium features)
```

**Note**: PRO-PLUS and ULTRA will likely share the same dashboard component with feature gating based on exact tier, rather than separate dashboard components.

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Jan 2025 | Start with FREE/PRO only | Simplify initial implementation, faster time to market |
| TBD | Add PRO-PLUS tier | Based on user feedback and business needs |
| TBD | Add ULTRA tier | Based on market demand for premium features |
