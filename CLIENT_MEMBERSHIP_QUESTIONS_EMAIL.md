Subject: Membership Tier Strategy - Need Your Input on Search & Visibility Features

Hi [Client Name],

I hope this email finds you well! I'm making great progress on the membership tier access control system, and I've successfully implemented the core protection layers to prevent FREE users from accessing PRO features.

However, I've reached a critical decision point where I need your business guidance on how membership tiers should affect the user experience for clients browsing the platform. These decisions will significantly impact your monetization strategy and user conversion rates.

**Key Questions I Need Your Input On:**

1. **Search Result Ranking:**
   - Should PRO ladies appear higher in search results than FREE ladies?
   - Do you want PRO members to get priority positioning/visibility?
   - Should there be any difference in how they appear in browse/search?

2. **Membership Tier Visibility:**
   - Should clients be able to see which ladies are FREE vs PRO (badges, indicators)?
   - Should search filters include membership tier options?
   - Do you want the tier to be completely invisible to clients?

3. **Content Preview Strategy:**
   - Should FREE users see locked content with "Upgrade to PRO" teasers?
   - Or should PRO features be completely hidden from FREE users?
   - How aggressive should the upgrade prompts be?

4. **Client Experience:**
   - When clients interact with FREE ladies, should they see limited features?
   - Should there be any messaging about tier limitations?
   - How do you want to handle the user experience flow?

**Why This Matters:**
These decisions directly impact your conversion funnel and revenue strategy. Different approaches can significantly affect:
- User retention vs upgrade pressure
- Competitive positioning in the market
- Overall platform perceived value

**What I've Built So Far:**
✅ Complete 3-layer protection system (Frontend, API, Database)
✅ Professional upgrade prompts and user flows
✅ Development testing capabilities
✅ Secure membership validation

**Next Steps:**
Once I have your guidance on these business strategy questions, I can quickly implement the search ranking logic and finalize the user experience flows.

Would you be available for a quick call this week to discuss these points? Or if you prefer, just reply with your preferences and I'll implement accordingly.

Looking forward to your input!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
